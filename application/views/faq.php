                <h4>What is the SNEAKERTUB?</h4>
                <p class="ans">SNEAKERTUB is a monthly mystery Sneaker subscription service delivering a curated package
                    of
                    Sneakers
                    and sneaker accessories from top brands to your door step.</p>

            <div class="col-md-12 q2">
                <h4>How does it work?</h4>
                <p class="ans">Each month we handpick a pair of Sneakers and a few sneaker accesossories and send you
                    box full of
                    Sneaker Awesomeness in the Mail. You can pick from four different packages. We ship each month's
                    package at the end of the Month. To qualify for the current month's shipment, customers have to sign
                    up before the cutoff date (20th of each month). International deliveries (Non North American) might
                    take longer to ship.</p>
